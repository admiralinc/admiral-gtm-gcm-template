Admiral provides a custom Google Tag Manager template that allows publishers to communicate visitor consent choices to Google and third-party tags that support consent mode. To get started using this template, download this repo onto your local machine and import it in the **Templates** section of Google Tag Manager. You can find full documentation for getting set up with this template [here](https://docs.getadmiral.com/docs/js-api-consent-mode).
